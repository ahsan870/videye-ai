# VidEye AI - Traffic Intersection Monitoring System

## Overview
VidEye AI is an advanced traffic monitoring system that uses artificial intelligence to analyze vehicle movements at different types of road intersections. The application processes video footage to track vehicles and provide detailed analytics about traffic patterns and movement distributions.

## Features
- üé• Real-time video processing
- üöó Vehicle detection and tracking
- üìä Comprehensive traffic analytics
- üõ£Ô∏è Support for multiple road types:
  - 4-way intersections
  - T-junctions
  - 2-way roads
- üìç Multiple camera position support
- üìà Detailed movement analysis
- üì• Exportable results in CSV format

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Webcam or video file for analysis
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahsan870/videye-ai.git
cd videye-ai
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
